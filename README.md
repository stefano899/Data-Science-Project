List of projects that i made during the Data Analytics and Data-Driven decision Exam in which:
  - For the first project (PhishingFinale) i made a binary tree classificator for the classification of Phishing/Non-Phishing sites, with statistical analysis
  - For the second project and third project (Challenge Avezzano/Pescara) i predicted the estimated contract sales for the cities located in abruzzo. After that i designed a decision optimization algorithm that estimates the optimal backbone network, given the data from the dataset.
